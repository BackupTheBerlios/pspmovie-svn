This is pspmovie - encoder and manager for video files on Sony Portable
Playstation (aka PSP).

* Supported output format
pspmovie support MP4 format, 320x240 with several bitrate settings
for video and audio stream.
Video can be automatically padded and resized to be correctly displayed
on PSP screen (which is 480x272).

* Movie transfer
Connected PSP device will be automatically detected

* Build requirements/instructions
pspmovie links statically to FFMPEG code. Reason for this is bug in
released versions of ffmpeg, which cause broken headers of MP4 files.
As a result, PSP will not display title of movie, which is quite
annoying.
Build order for tar.gz. versions (releases):
	1. Go to ffmpeg directory: cd ffmpeg
	2. Run configure: ./configure --disable-ffplay --disable-ffserver
	 --disable-v4l --enable-gpl --enable-a52 --enable-faad
	   --disable-vhook --disable-network
	3. Build ffmpeg: make
	4. Go to source directory: cd ..
	5. Build pspmovie: qmake pspmovie.pro && make
